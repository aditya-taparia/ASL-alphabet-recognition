# ASL Alphabet Recognition
<p align="justify">This Jupiter notebook file covers the implementation of a machine learning algorithm for detecting the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. For this project, we are using the Sign Language MNIST dataset, which contains 24 classes for the alphabet A to Z, excluding J and Z from the dataset because they can't be captured in a single image (as it is a gesture). The motivation for this project is to make a translator for the signers.</p>
